Hi! I am **D371L**.

I developed this high-conversion landing page for a real client — mental coach **Artem Boikov**. The project delivered excellent results in production, so we decided to open-source the code.

This project is now **Open Source**. This means you can take this code, modify the text, images, and colors, and use it for your own business or portfolio completely for free.

**Live Demo:** [mindset.iceking.guru](https://mindset.iceking.guru)

## 💡 Project Philosophy

This project is the antithesis of "heavy" websites built on WordPress or React for simple tasks.
- **0 Dependencies**: No `npm install` needed to run.
- **Clean Code**: Pure HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN for simplicity), and Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Speed**: Instant load times and 100/100 in Google PageSpeed.
- **RTL**: Full Hebrew support (Right-to-Left), but easily adaptable to any language.

## 🚀 How to Launch in 5 Minutes

You don't need to be a programmer. Just download the files.

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser. The site is already working!
3. Open the same file in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++) to change the content.

## ⚙️ Configuration Checklist (Important)

Since this is code from a live project, it contains the client's real data. **You must replace the following with your own:**

1.  **Contacts:**
    *   Find the phone number `972543319843` and replace it with yours (for WhatsApp buttons).
    *   Search for `wa.me/...` links and ensure they point to your number.

2.  **SEO & Domain:**
    *   Replace the domain `mindset.iceking.guru` with yours in `index.html`, `public/sitemap.xml`, and `public/robots.txt`.
    *   Update the `meta` tags (Title, Description) in `index.html`.

3.  **Analytics:**
    *   At the very top of `index.html`, there is a Google Analytics tag (`G-6JGLVDGMD9`). Remove it or replace it with your own Measurement ID.

4.  **Images:**
    *   Replace `header_logo.png`, `favicon.png`, and `profilepic.png` with your own assets.
